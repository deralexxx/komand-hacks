From time to time I was faced with the challange to create a list of Strings that can be itterated in a workflow step.

Hacky way after a hint was using the python module.

Module to use: Python
Name: <YourPreferedName>
Input: {}
Function: See attached .py script
Output: Add a new list: {{YourPreferedName.list}} - list
  
Happy using
